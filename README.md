Share a diagram file to open in the online diagram viewer

To create a shareable link to your diagram file, follow the steps below.


    1. Make sure your diagram is available on the internet, and copy its address (URL). If your diagram is stored in Google Drive, copy its shareable link.
    Go to: https://jgraph.github.io/drawio-tools/tools/viewer.html Share a diagram using diagram.net's free online diagram viewer
    Paste the URL of the diagram file in the Link to Diagram text field.
    Choose how youâ€™d like the diagram to appear:
        Full Screen Mode (default) generates a link that when clicked on, opens the diagram in the lightbox. From here, you can print the diagram, export it as a PNG image, or create a copy to edit in the diagram editor.
        Editor generates a link that when clicked on, immediately converts the diagram at that address and opens it in the diagram editor.
        IFrame generates HTML code for an iFrame that you can paste into your website. Set a Height for the iFrame - the default is 400px.
    Click Here! to generate the link or the iFrame code. Copy the link and share it, or copy the iFrame code and add it to a web page.
